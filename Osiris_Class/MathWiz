Challenge Text:-
I found some hard math lying around. Can you help me out?
nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1236

Solution:-
The text suggests to use the command 'nc' to login to the challenge server.
After login, we are presented with a series of simple math questions. Once you start solving these basic math questions, you realize there are lot many 
questions to be solved manually and this would require a script to solve.
Note:- The input questions are sometimes in the form of characters as well so we will have to take that case into account in our script.

Script:-
"""
import re
import subprocess

num_dict = {"ZERO": 0, "ONE": 1, "TWO":2, "THREE":3, "FOUR":4, "FIVE":5, "SIX":6, "SEVEN":7, "EIGHT":8, "NINE":9}
proc = subprocess.Popen(["nc", "offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu", "1236"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
proc.stdin.write(b'gc2877\n')
proc.stdin.flush()
for line in proc.stdout:
   print("[INFO] " + line.decode("utf-8"))
   if '=' in line.decode("utf-8"):
      eq = line.decode("utf-8").split('=')[0]
      for key in num_dict.keys():
        if key in line.decode("utf-8"):
            pattern = re.compile(r'[ ][+-\/*][ ]')
            operator = pattern.findall(line.decode("utf-8").split('=')[0])[0]
            eq_split = line.decode("utf-8").split('=')[0].split(operator)
            eq = ""
            count = 0
            for num in eq_split:
               count = count + 1
               if '-' in num:
                  num_split = num.split('-')
                  for word in num_split:
                     eq = eq + str(num_dict[word.strip()])
               else:
                  eq = eq + num
               if count == 1:
                  eq = eq + operator
                     
      eq_soln = eval(eq)
      proc.stdin.write((str(eq_soln) + '\n').encode("utf-8"))
      proc.stdin.flush()
      
"""

This uses the 'subprocess.Popen()' method to establish a connection and continuously submits the result of the math problems provided using the 'eval' method.
Once run, you are presented with the flag.

Note:- An easier way to change the character input of numbers to actual numbers would be to replace the strings using our dictionary
